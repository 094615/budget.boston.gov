     <div>"This budget is a manifestation of my vision for a
     Thriving, Healthy, and Innovative Boston."</div>
     <div>- Martin J. Walsh, Mayor</div>
   description: >
     Mayor Walsh presented a balanced budget that maintains 
     high levels of support in critical areas such as education 
     and public safety, makes limited strategic investments,
     continues the City's commitment to addressing its long-term
     liabilities, and builds on the Administration's record of 
     strong fiscal management. This is made possible by the 
     Administration's achievement of efficiencies and savings. 
     The City's data-driven managerial approach was recently 
     validated by the affirmation of Boston's triple A bond rating.
