SERVICING THE DEBT


In the area of debt service, the City continued to benefit from favorable interest rates and its position as an attractive investment, and borrowed at its lowest rate in recent history, while receiving high premium on the FY16 bond issue. This is keeping debt service costs lower than they otherwise would have been in FY17. Even with the recent favorable borrowings, debt service costs are projected to increase by $13.4 million in FY17. These growing debt service costs support the Cityâ€™s Building a Better Boston Capital Program.
