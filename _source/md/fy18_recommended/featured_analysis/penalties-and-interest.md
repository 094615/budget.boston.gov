      Taxpayers are assessed both a penalty and interest for late 
      payments of property tax bills, motor vehicle excise bills 
      and other payments.

      The City collected $13.1 million in such penalties and interest 
      in FY15 and $14.5 million in FY16. Actual penalty and interest 
      collections for FY17 will exceed the budget of $8.5 million and
