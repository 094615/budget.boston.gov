     "The Streets Cabinet will increase by 0.1% in FY17.  The Office of Streets will grow by 8.3% as the Chief of Streets, newly appointed in FY16, works to strengthen coordination, innovation and strategy across the Public Works and Transportation departments. The FY17 budget includes funding for a plan to reform the moving permit process.",
     "The Public Works Departmentâ€™s FY17 appropriation is level with FY16.  The department has realized savings from reduced waste disposal tonnage, eliminated long-term vacant positions, and has committed to reducing overtime hours by 5%.  In FY17 Public Works is looking for alternative uses for the latex paint collected at annual paint drops.  An investment in GPS survey equipment will allow the engineering program to more efficiently measure survey points.",

In FY17 the department will release the GoBoston 2030 action plan which will specify next steps in creating a more sustainable, equitable and efficient transportation network. The budget continues to support the Boston Bike program and community bicycle activities."
