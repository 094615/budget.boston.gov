REVITALIZING FIRE ENGINES AND LADDERS

The Fire Department’s operational review identified several needed improvements to existing fleet operations, including updated long and short-term fleet replacement plans. The department has worked to identify opportunities for improvement and outline concrete plans for success. In FY17, Boston will launch a revamped apparatus replacement plan. As part of the plan to replace 48% of the fleet within 4 years, and 78% within 8 years, the department will acquire 15 new apparatus in FY17. This is the first year of a longterm plan to promote firefighter safety and improve the state of apparatus.

In FY17, the City will also ensure appropriate staffing levels in the repair shop, as well as provide new resources to capture revenue for warranty repairs that is currently being lost. In concert with Mayor Walsh’s focus on data-driven decision making, the Fire Department is exploring updated fleet management software, as well as improvements to its fuel dispensing system to better analyze their performance going forward.
