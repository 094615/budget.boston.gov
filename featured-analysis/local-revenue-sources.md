The City is projecting property tax revenue growth of 4.9%, again driven by new growth. Boston’s property tax revenue is significantly constrained by Proposition 2 ½, meaning that while property values are growing swiftly, Boston’s levy on existing property is limited to 2 ½% growth. In this economy, Boston is benefiting from new growth, or new property tax levied on new construction. However, as was evident during the last recession – new growth revenue is volatile, and will drop when the market causes construction to slow.
Local receipts, which include revenues such as excises, fees, fines, and permits, are projected to grow at $15.9 million (3.4%). Boston is projecting strong room occupancy and meals excise revenue as well as continued permit revenue growth from commercial and residential real estate development. Also in local receipts, Boston is projecting declining 121A revenue as expiring property tax incentives convert to property taxes.
