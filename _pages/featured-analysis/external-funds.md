EXTERNAL FUNDS
The City’s $2.97 billion operating budget is
supplemented by approximately $327.2 million in
external funds. These funds consist mainly of federal,
state, and private funding earmarked for specific
purposes. Education, housing, economic development,
public health and public safety are some of the largest
areas for which these funds are targeted.
Twenty-six departments and agencies expect to
receive federal, state or other forms of external
funding in FY17. Over 93% of the City’s external funds
are found in eight of those twenty-six departments.
These eight departments are Boston Public Schools,
Neighborhood Development, Public Health
Commission, Police Department, Fire Department,
Office of Emergency Management, Library
Department, and the Elderly Commission. Other
departments that also have significant grant funding
are the Parks and Recreation Department, Office of
Economic Development and the Transportation
Department. Descriptions and amounts of grants by
department can be found in Volumes II and III.
Federal grants have historically provided funding for
key City priorities for education, community
development, and services for seniors. Boston Public
Schools, the Department of Neighborhood
Development, and the Elderly Commission have been
the traditional recipients of recurring entitlement
grants provided by the federal government.
The City will continue to receive Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME funding
for a variety of neighborhood development activities.
Other sources of federal funding received by the City
are used to address diverse needs and/or creative
approaches for homeland security, community policing
and housing support for the homeless.
