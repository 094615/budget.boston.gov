CITY HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS

The City is projecting a 5.4% increase in health care related costs for City employees and retirees, primarily due to an increased cost trend for pharmaceuticals.

Non-departmental appropriations are increasing by $27 million, and are being driven largely by growing health insurance costs and a reserve for collective bargaining increases to be negotiated in the next round of agreements.

The net impact of those cost increases are muted partially by savings realized through the most recent Public Employee Committee (PEC) Agreement negotiated by the Walsh Administration in 2014, and projected to save at least $45 million through 2020. This agreement includes incremental decreases in the City share of premium over several years, competitive bidding of offerings, reduction in expensive and duplicative plan options, and exploration of possible pharmacy management alternatives to reduce future costs. Consistent with national and local trends, Boston’s health care costs have dramatically increased since 2001. Combined with long-term post-employment benefits, these costs now constitute a larger (12.7%) share of the City’s budget. This nationwide trend increases the significance of savings opportunities provided through the PEC agreement, which took effect this past July.
