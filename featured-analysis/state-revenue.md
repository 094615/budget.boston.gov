STATE REVENUE


State revenue, the City’s second largest revenue source, never recovered following the last recession.

In FY17, Boston’s state revenue is budgeted to grow at $8.5 million, 2.0% over FY16. This is still $60.8 million, or 12.3%, lower than Boston’s state aid in FY08. Over that same time, state assessments, driven largely by Boston’s Charter School Tuition Assessment, have grown by $117.1 million. Together this has caused Boston’s net state aid to decline by nearly $178 million over the last decade. This trend is unsustainable and will continue to have major programmatic impacts unless reversed.


State aid refers primarily to distributions from the
Commonwealth to municipalities for Chapter 70
Education Aid, Unrestricted General Government Aid,
Charter School Tuition Reimbursement along with other
relatively small Commonwealth programs such as library
aid and various reimbursements. State aid, as it is used
here, excludes any grants to or offsets for direct
expenditure by City departments. It also includes
reimbursements from the Massachusetts School Building
Authority (MSBA).
The City received general fund gross state aid totaling
$422.4 million in FY14 and $413.4 million in FY15. The City
expects to receive $424.0 million in state aid in FY16 and
has budgeted $432.6 million in gross state aid in FY17, 2%
over FY16.
”Municipal Charges”, also known as, “State Assessments”
are charged by the Commonwealth to municipalities for
items such as Charter School Tuition Reimbursement and
MBTA service. State aid distributions are reduced by the
amount of assessments charged to a municipality. The City
paid $194.1 million in FY14 and $211.7 million in FY15.
The City expects to pay $234.5 million in assessments in FY16 and is budgeting $245.4 million in FY17. The largest
assessments are those of the Charter School Tuition and
MBTA. The former has rapidly increased since the
enactment of the 2010 legislation that expanded the
number of charter school seats.
Net state aid, which is gross state aid revenue minus state
assessments, has been trending down steeply since FY02.
The rapid annual increase in the Charter School Tuition
Assessment, combined with reductions in education and
general government aid, contributed to this trend (Figure
8). With a decrease in net state aid for FY17, Boston is
$177.8 million, or 56%, below its FY08 level of net state aid
of $365.1 million. This loss of resources has put
extraordinary pressure on the property tax and other local
revenue sources as well as levels of expenditures. To
mitigate some of this loss, the state expanded local option
taxing authority and created savings opportunities, but
their combined value does not offset the aggregate losses
in net state aid. Net state aid amounted to $228.3 million in FY14 and
$201.8 million in FY15. FY16 budgeted net state aid totals
$189.5 million and the FY17 Budget assumes a reduction
to $187.2 million.
