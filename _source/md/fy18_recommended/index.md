       <li>maintains high levels of support for educating Boston's students 
       and keeping the City of Boston safe;</li>
       <li>expands upon strategic initiatives to achieve cost savings; and</li>
       <li>positions the City to manage through instability at the national level.</li>

    body: >
      Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s proposed $3.14 billion Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18) budget 
      balances sustainability, increased investment, and fiscal responsibility. Continuing 
      trends seen in recent years, the Mayor’s proposed FY18 budget relies on growth in 
      property tax and other local receipt revenue, but requires control of growth in 
      departmental spending to offset weak state aid revenue and high fixed cost growth. 
      Budgetary growth is maintained at a responsible level given the need to maintain 
      flexibility in the face of continuing uncertainty at other levels of government. Despite 
      these challenges, the budget makes strong statements about the City’s priorities, as is 
      reflected in the proposed investments.

      <h5>Expaning on savings</h5>
      <p>Even with strong growth in locally derived revenues, it is only through continued 
      tightening within City departments that the City will be able to afford new and expanded 
      investments after reserving for costs associated with collective bargaining, being 
      assessed for its increasing charter school costs, funding its pension obligations, 
      and paying its debt service. <blockquote>The FY18 proposal builds off of past budgets by 
      expanding savings initiatives, and allows for dollars to be used in high impact 
      areas.</blockquote></p>
      <h5>Federal challenges</h5>
      <p>Mayor Walsh’s FY18 budget stands in contrast to national efforts to dismantle the 
      urban safety net, as seen in the proposed Federal budget. The President has proposed 
      to eliminate critical federal programs that support the production of affordable housing, 
      revitalize Boston’s Main Streets, make heating bills affordable to 20,000 Boston
      residents, and provide Boston students with valuable after-school programs.</p>

      <h5>Taking advantage of data</h5>
      <p>In contrast, Mayor Walsh is proposing data-driven investments that meet the core 
      needs of Bostonians, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>targeting research-backed education investments - including extending the 
          school day for 15,000 students - to close achievement and opportunity gaps;</li>
          <li>directing educational resources to students most in need, including 3,000 
          BPS students experiencing homelessness;</li>
          <li>building on early success from the Mayor’s homeless action plan implementation;</li>
          <li>further extending access to addiction treatment services;</li>
          <li>using data to change the way Boston deploys emergency services to Boston 
          Common and Recovery Road;</li>
          <li>making sure that city streets in every neighborhood are clean and safe with 
          revitalized lane markings and crosswalks;</li>
          <li>continuing efforts to diversify Boston’s Police force by adding police 
          cadets;</li>
          <li>ensuring that Boston’s open spaces are among the nation’s most equitable 
          and accessible;</li>
          <li>supporting local artists through grantmaking and residencies;</li>
          <li>launching infrastructure projects driven by Imagine Boston 2030 and Go Boston 
          2030, moving from engagement and planning to action; and</li>
          <li>setting funding aside for future projects coming out of the BuildBPS engagement 
          process and partnerships with the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA).</li>
        </ul>
