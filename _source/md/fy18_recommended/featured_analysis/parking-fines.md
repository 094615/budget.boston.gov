    short_desc: >
      In FY16, the City issued over 1.3 million parking tickets and has 
      maintained a 92% rate of collection on those tickets.
    description: >
      The major factors contributing to the City’s successful collection rate include:
      <ul>
        <li>non-renewal of violator’s registration and license by the Registry of Motor
        Vehicles until penalties are paid</li>
        <li>booting and towing of vehicles</li>
        <li>increased ability to recover fine payments from rental agencies, and</li>
        <li>systematic collection of fines for company cars and leased vehicles.</li>
      </ul>
      The City also contracts with a third-party vendor to collect delinquent fines 
      from out of state vehicles and other hard to reach offenders.
