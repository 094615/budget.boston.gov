ENERGY MANAGEMENT
In FY17 department energy budgets total $51.8 million
with electricity costs making up 51% of the budget,
natural gas costs making up 26% of the budget and
gasoline/diesel comprising 11% of the budgets. The
remaining 12% of the budget funds water and sewer,
steam, and heating oil.
In FY17, the Walsh Administration plans to make
energy efficiency improvements to City buildings,
under an initiative entitled “Renew Boston Trust”.
This initiative aims to bundle municipal energy
efficiency renovation projects and capture the
resulting financial savings. The City plans to finance
the program with general obligation bonds payable in
part with the financial savings that resulted from reduced energy consumption. The City expects to
implement the program through contracts with Energy
Service Companies (ESCOs) that will provide
financial guarantees that the energy savings generated
by the projects will be sufficient to cover anticipated
debt service costs. To better track and control energy
use, the City is re-procuring a cloud-based Enterprise
Energy Management System (“EEMS”). The current
EEMS enables the City to monitor and report on the
energy consumed by its 314 buildings and other fixed
assets, and its vehicle fleet, and is used by the City to
meet its public reporting obligation under the Building
Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance.
The City’s electricity requirements have been met by
third-party commodity supply contractors since March
2005. To date, the amounts the City has paid to its
third-party electricity suppliers have been less than
the amounts it would have paid if it had continued to
accept default electric service from its local
distribution company, Eversource, formerly known as
NSTAR – Boston Edison.
