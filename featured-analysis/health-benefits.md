 HEALTH BENEFITS
The Walsh Administration has continued the City’s
record of achieving health care cost containment
reforms through the 2014 PEC agreement, which
projected to save $45 million over five years. Despite
this success, in FY16 and FY17, health insurance costs
are increasing at a higher rate than other City costs
due to pharmaceutical cost drivers, consistent with
trends in the broader Massachusetts market.
The FY17 budget includes $378 million for all health
benefit related costs for the City’s employees and
retirees, comprising 12.7% of total City expenditures --
compared to 7.6% in 2001. $42.25 million of these
costs for future OPEB liabilities are discussed in more
detail in the following section. $335.7 million for
current health, dental and life premiums and
employer Medicare payroll taxes are addressed below.
Annual costs for health, dental and life insurance and
Medicare taxes have increased 155% since FY01,
compared to a 66% increase for all other City costs.
Figure 7 shows three distinct periods of annual cost
increases. Steep cost increases averaged 15% per year
from FY01 – FY08. A significant lowering of the City’s
baseline costs then occurred between FY09 – FY15 due
to multiple factors including state health reform
legislation, cooperative efforts by the City and its
unions to reduce both the City’s share of costs and
total costs, and lower nationwide health care cost
trends. 

Mandatory Medicare Enrollment
Municipal health care reform legislation passed by the
State legislature in 2011 provided municipalities more
freedom in health plan design, and also mandated that
all Medicare-eligible municipal retirees enroll in
Medicare Part B and a City sponsored Medicare
supplement plan. As a direct result of mandated
Medicare enrollment, approximately 4,500 more City
retirees and their spouses enrolled in Medicare
supplement plans, for which benefits remain
comparable to non-Medicare plans but costs are lower
due to Medicare reimbursements. City premium
savings from this mandate, beginning in FY13, have
totaled approximately $20 million annually – a major
contributor to the total decrease in FY13 costs shown
in Table 2.
City retirees and their beneficiaries are eligible for
Medicare through payment of Medicare payroll taxes
during their working career. Medicare taxes have
been paid for all City employees who were hired after
March 1986: 1.45% paid by the employee and 1.45% by
the City. City Medicare taxes, totaling $18.47 million
in the FY17 budget, have increased an average 12%
annually since FY01. This growth is due to increases
in total payroll and also the increasing percentage of
total employees who were hired after March 1986 and
impacted by the tax.

City - Union Partnership
Assisted by 2011 municipal health care reform, the
City adopted MGL Chapter 32B S.19 and began
working closely with its thirty six unions, as
represented through the Public Employee Committee
(PEC), in making health care changes. Through the
City and PEC’s two coalition bargaining agreements
signed in 2011 and 2015, City employees and retirees
are now paying a higher share of total health care
costs through increased premium share and higher copays
for office visits and pharmaceutical costs. Figure
8 shows the City’s reduced share of total costs for its
most popular non-Medicare health plan, from
approximately 82% in FY11 to 78% in FY16. This is still
higher than the estimated 68% employer share for a
state employee enrolled in the Group Insurance
Commission. Today, the City’s total annual health
care costs are estimated to be $20 million lower than
they would have been if not for these changes. 


In FY15, the City and the PEC entered into their
second agreement, which is projected to reduce
projected costs by a total $45 million over five years.
This most recent agreement is unique because it
includes not only a continued increase in member cost
share, but also multiple other approaches to
containing total costs for both the City and members.
• The Agreement includes competitive bidding and
refinement of the City’s health plan options.
After the elimination of a costly indemnity plan
in FY12 saving several million dollars annually,
non-Medicare health plan options were further
reduced in FY16 to three plans: one PPO
(Indemnity) with an open provider network, and
two HMO managed plans with a local provider
network. Savings of over $1 million dollars per
year in administrative fees were realized from
this change which is shared by both employees
and the City. In FY18, Medicare plans offered by
the City will also be reduced to three.
• The FY15 PEC agreement continued to prioritize
funding of health care costs through selfinsurance
wherever possible. In FY13 the City
began self-insuring most of its health plans,
reducing total costs by over $10 million per year.
• In FY16, also as part of the current PEC
agreement, the City and the PEC will begin
exploring alternatives for management of the
City’s prescription benefits, for possible future
savings. This effort is timely with pharmaceutical costs now the primary driver
behind increasing claims trends.
Health Claims Trends
Nationally, health claims costs from FY11 - FY14
increased at a lower rate, contributing to lower
premium increases. Claims costs, largely
pharmaceutical, began increasing at higher rates in
FY15, leading to premium increases of 7% in FY16 and
FY17. The City is limited in its ability to influence the
multiple causes behind health care cost increases,
which can include increasing medical provider
charges, an aging population, overuse of certain
services, high utilization of more expensive hospitals,
and unhealthy lifestyle choices of members. The most
recent PEC agreement however, includes plans to
address some of these issues through wellness and
disease management programs.
