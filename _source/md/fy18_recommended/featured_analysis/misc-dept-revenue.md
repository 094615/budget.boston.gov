      With such limited revenue tools, the City is launching an 
      initiative in the FY18 budget to better maximize local revenue 
      tools. The FY18 budget includes an additional $9.7 million 
      identified in departmental revenues.

      In FY18, the Office of Budget Management will initiate revenue 
      audits to verify the accuracy of information reported with certain 
      fees. The City anticipates recovering $2 million in revenue through 
      these audits. This City will also work to maximize federal health 
      insurance reimbursements and address past due bills to recover revenue.
