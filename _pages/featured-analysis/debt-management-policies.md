DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND DEBT
	IMPLICATIONS OF THE PLAN
	Effective debt management ensures that the City can
	meet its capital infrastructure and facility needs. Debt
	management requires a series of decisions about the
	amount, timing, purposes and structure of debt
	issuance. Long-term debt related to capital
	investment has two main purposes:
	(1) It finances acquisition, construction, repair, and
	renovation of City-owned buildings and equipment
	that are necessary to provide public services; and
	(2) It finances infrastructure improvements to ensure
	the City’s continued growth and safe roadway
	conditions.
	The Treasury Department manages all borrowings
	according to the City’s debt management policies.

	These policies address issues such as debt
affordability and limitations on the level of variable
rate debt the City will use. The City’s goals are to
rapidly repay debt, maintain a conservative level of
outstanding debt, and ensure the City’s continued
positive financial standing with the bond market.
Key components of the debt management policies
ensure that:
• combined net direct debt does not exceed
3% of taxable assessed value;
• at least 40% of the overall debt is repaid
within five years and 70% within ten years;
• annual gross debt service costs do not
exceed 7% of general fund expenditures;
• variable rate debt does not exceed 20% of
the City’s total currently outstanding
bonded debt (the City has no variable debt).
For further discussion of the City’s financial policies
and management controls, refer to the chapter on
Financial Management. 

The City’s debt service forecast assumes general
obligation borrowing of $153 million in FY17, $167
million in FY18, $160 million in FY19, $155 million in
FY20 and $140 million in FY21. On March 8, 2016, the
City sold $140 million in general obligation bonds to
fund its capital improvement projects, and $8.1 million
in general obligation refunding bonds. The debt tables
at the end of this chapter detail the City’s outstanding
debt service obligations and demonstrate the City’s
rapid retirement of its debt. 

The City’s gross debt service requirement will remain
under 7% of total General Fund expenditures through
FY21 (See Figure 3).
The ratio of debt service to the City’s primary revenue
source, the property tax levy, is projected to increase
through FY17 (See Figure 4). Even with the increase,
the ratio is not expected to exceed the City’s policy
ceiling. 

The City’s current overall debt burden (net direct debt
to assessed property value of $128.05 billion) is
approximately 0.96% as of April 30, 2016. The City’s net
direct debt per capita currently stands at
approximately $1,866.41 as of April 30, 2016.
Boston has been conservative about assuming longterm
debt and aggressive about retiring debt
expeditiously. As of April 30, 2016, the City’s debt
retirement schedule shows that 41.3% of its principal
will be retired five years out, before the end of FY21
(See the Debt Retirement table at the end of this
chapter).
In March of 2016, Moody’s Investors Service and
Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed Boston’s credit rating at
Aaa, and AAA, respectively. A bond rating is a
statement of credit quality and is analyzed when
determining the interest rate that should be paid for a
municipality’s bonds. A higher bond rating translates
into lower interest rates and real dollar savings for the
City.
