LAUNCHING THE EARLY VOTING INITIATIVE

Registered Boston voters will be able to vote at a location and time that is most convenient for them.


Boston will expand access to democracy through the Early Voting Initiative. A vibrant democracy furthers Mayor Walsh’s goal of a thriving, healthy, innovative Boston, and the Early Voting Initiative will increase voting opportunities for all qualified voters in each of the city’s nine council districts for the November 2016 election. With election officials preparing for heavy turnouts and multiple page ballots for the November 2016 Presidential and State election, this initiative will make participation more convenient for all, particularly those who face work schedule, family obligation, or other obstacles to going to the polls.

To ensure equitable access, this investment goes well beyond the state requirement of one early voting site to be open during normal business hours. Boston will implement early voting sites in each City Council District, as well as provide voting opportunities in the evening and on the weekend to better serve voters in every neighborhood.
