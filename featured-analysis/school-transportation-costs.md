SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION COSTS

Boston spends over $100 million on school transportation, or 10% of the BPS budget.

Although Superintendent Chang is actively working to find every possible efficiency in the BPS Transportation Department, transportation costs will remain high in the near future due to a number of benefits BPS provides to its families. For example, to prevent disruption to families when BPS moved to the Home Base school assignment system, BPS allows students and their siblings to stay in their old schools, regardless of the distance from their home. This is a great benefit to families, but these exceptions increase the geographic distribution of a school’s students, lead to vacant buses, and create inefficiencies that limit the district’s ability to manage transportation costs.
