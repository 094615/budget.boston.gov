BOSTON INVESTS IN EDUCATION

The School Committee approved a $1.032 billion budget for the Boston Public Schools. This brings total education spending (including district and charter schools) to 40% of the city budget.


This budget represents a $15.4 million increase over the previous fiscal year, an amount that could go up when the next round of collective bargaining agreements are negotiated.

The City’s investment in the Boston Public Schools is more robust than ever. According to a report by the US Census Bureau, the Boston Public Schools invest more money per student than any of the 100 largest school districts in the nation. Much of this investment is purposeful and results-driven, but some is the result of inefficiency. For example, the Administration believes investing in quality teachers leads to better student outcomes. And in fact, BPS spends 54% more on its teachers than other districts do (according to a report by Education Resource Strategies). BPS’s student to teacher ratios are 17% lower than the district’s peers, and Boston pays teachers 29% more. Boston also instituted a policy of mutual consent hiring, which gives school leaders more autonomy to hire quality, diverse teachers. However, it has also left the district with a very expensive excess teacher pool.

Teacher compensation and transportation are just two examples of areas where Boston invests more heavily than comparison districts. Others include Special Education and English Language Learning. For example, next year BPS is increasing resources for its English Language Learning population, and expanding ELL academic programs, Sheltered English Immersion programs and teacher training.
