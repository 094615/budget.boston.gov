      weathered the storms of previous recessions. However, several major revenue
      sources never fully recovered, cost pressures continued to grow, and deferred

Mayor Walsh presented a balanced budget that maintains high levels of support in critical areas such as education and public safety, makes limited strategic investments, continues the City’s commitment to addressing its long-term liabilities, and builds on the Administration’s record of strong fiscal management.

This is made possible by the Administration’s achievement of efficiencies and savings.

The City’s data-driven managerial approach was recently validated by the affirmation of Boston’s triple A bond rating.

The AAA rating reflects the city's strong fiscal management and stable financial position...

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE quote
At the time Mayor Walsh took office, the City of Boston had successfully weathered the storms of previous recessions.

However, several major revenue sources never fully recovered, cost pressures continued to grow, and deferred investments persisted across City government.

In its first two years, the administration has systematically engaged in independent operational reviews and other planning efforts aimed at making government more efficient in order to address areas needing renewed attention. 


GROWING FISCAL PRESSURE
After conducting operational reviews on the City’s largest departments and reviewing fiscal capacity, the Administration anticipates growing fiscal pressure, resulting from: 


Limited revenue tools beyond property tax “new growth” to address rising costs.
The Boston Public Schools’ facilities, operations, human resources, and transportation systems being designed for past generations of students, creating an inefficient cost structure in need of dramatic reform.
The City’s Charter School Tuition Assessment having risen by $100 million over the last ten years, while the Charter School Reimbursement Aid to municipalities has been dramatically underfunded, with Boston losing $28 million over the past two fiscal years. 
City funding for education (BPS and charter tuition) making up a growing portion of the City’s Budget, up to 40% in FY17, while state education aid has declined to 7.3% of the City’s revenue.
The Boston Police Patrolmen’s 2013 arbitration award creating an unsustainable precedent for public safety salary increases that come at the cost of other City spending.
The Police Department’s overtime costs having risen to excessive levels, despite higher staffing levels. 
Due to generations of underfunding the City’s pension obligations, the City’s pension schedule requiring an 8% increase in our payment each year.
Health insurance costs again increasing at a higher rate than other City costs despite successful health care cost containment reforms including the recent Public Employee Committee Agreement anticipating $45 million in new savings.

FY17 PRIORITIES DETAILS


Increasing access to quality early childhood education

Mayor Walsh is committed to ensuring that every child in Boston gets off to the right start in life. Currently, 90% of Boston’s 6,000 four year olds are enrolled in a preschool program, whether school or community-based. However, not all programs guarantee well-trained and well-compensated teachers, a high-quality curriculum, a safe and supportive environment and opportunities for family engagement. Mayor Walsh wants to make sure that every preschool option in Boston is high quality and that all four-year olds in the city are able to participate in the best early learning programming in America.

To achieve this goal:

Mayor Walsh established a Universal Pre-K (UPK) Advisory Committee to develop initial recommendations for the development of a comprehensive mixed delivery UPK system modeled after BPS’s rigorously tested K1 system. The City is currently exploring ways to initiate quality-improving investments in both school classrooms and community-provider settings;
The Mayor’s Office worked with Boston Public Schools to invest in 200 new K1 seats in BPS schools over the last two years. In FY17, the Mayor and Superintendent Chang will invest $3 million to expand BPS K1 programming by another 200 seats; and
The Mayor’s Education Cabinet collaborated with the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care and counterparts from Lowell, Holyoke, Lawrence and Springfield to secure a $15 million federal preschool expansion grant to improve quality in and expand access to community-based programs. $3.5 million of the grant supported the efforts of Boston-based providers in the current school year. The federal government announced a second year of funding for Boston and its partner cities this past fall.
Investing Thoughtfully in Special Education

BPS is planning to invest in special education in three critical areas: support teams to work directly in schools with teachers and school staff, a new data system that will give parents timely and accurate access to IEP information, and transition services for students as they prepare to move on from BPS. These three investments are part of a broader commitment to provide better, more inclusive special education services in the least restrictive setting and to help all students prepare for success after they leave BPS.

Launching Excellence for All

Through a $1.2 M investment in the FY17 Budget, BPS is launching Excellence for All. This initiative grew out of Superintendent Chang’s 100 Day Plan for the start of his tenure in Boston. The initiative is intended to expand access to rigorous curriculum and enrichment experiences for students in Boston Public Schools. During school year 2016-2017 the district will focus on 4th grade classrooms, some in Advanced Work Class (AWC) schools and some in non-AWC schools. As a result of this initiative, hundreds of additional 4th grade students will have access to rigorous academic and enrichment experiences.

INVESTMENTS OVERVIEW


CHALLENGES
Complicating the dual challenges of limited fiscal capacity and the rising expectations for the delivery of City services are two unknown cost drivers that will impact FY17 and beyond.

Almost all of the City’s collective bargaining agreements will expire in FY17. Salary increases in these agreements will have a direct impact on dollars available in FY17 and in the coming years.
In addition, the proposed charter school cap ballot initiative could have a devastating effect on the City’s future finances, unless the State acts to address the charter school cap and transition financing in a way that protects Boston. 
The Walsh Administration has been successful in beginning to address these challenges, and this budget builds on that success. But without changing the way we do business, growth in the City’s budget threatens to become unsustainable. For that reason, limited investments in this operating budget must be funded through the enactment of cost saving reforms.

In FY17, the Walsh Administration will make government work better for those who live and work here by implementing reforms to improve service and reduce costs, continuing fiscally sustainable practices that have been key to the City’s economic success, and taking steps to meet the population’s changing needs. This approach is critical to Boston’s success in growing as a thriving, healthy and innovative city. 

REVENUE

EXPENDITURES
On the expenditure side, the FY17 budget reflects a $95.4 million (3.3%) growth over FY16 estimated expenditures.
Of that growth, City Departments, Boston Public Schools (BPS) and the Public Health Commission (PHC) (net health insurance and pension costs) are growing by $32.0 million or 1.7% over FY16 estimated spending. These departmental increases are low relative to other years due to the expiration of nearly all collective bargaining agreements by early in the fiscal year.

Only Fire and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) have negotiated wage increases set for FY17, and their budgets reflect that difference.

To afford limited investments in FY17, the City has implemented a number of cost saving reforms in FY17. Notably, Public Safety and Streets departments will cut employee overtime hours in FY17, saving the City $11.6 million. This budget builds on the success the Police Department has had in FY16 in reducing overtime hours from FY15.

City departments are saving about $4.7 million by inactivating over 100 vacant positions without impacting service levels. The City is achieving nearly $1 million in utility savings from reduced usage and lower rates, and almost $400,000 in savings by tightening waste and other contracted services budgets. The Public Health Commission is saving $1.4 million through a number of budget tightening measures; and while their budget continues to grow by more than other departments, BPS has committed to reducing costs in several areas, including significant savings in their transportation budget.

PUBLIC SAFETY OVERTIME
The Walsh Administration is fully budgeting for public safety overtime for the first time in more than 15 years.


The School Committee approved a $1.032 billion budget for the Boston Public Schools. This brings total education spending (including district and charter schools) to 40% of the city budget. This budget represents a $15.4 million increase over the previous fiscal year, an amount that could go up when the next round of collective bargaining agreements are negotiated.
