TAKING ACTIONS BASED ON DATA ANALYSIS



Following City’s success with data analytics in FY16 in launching internationally heralded CityScore, which measures the impact of city services on quality of life, using traffic data from the Waze app to improve the flow of vehicles on Boston roadways, and in improving the permitting experience through the development of a mix of smart technology, Boston will continue to build and expand upon this work in the coming year.

Plans include:

Enhancing CityScore and the Mayor’s Dashboard. Boston will further develop and refine the tools that are used to monitor and understand performance by adding new information, increasing functionality, and improving usefulness for the public.
Better identifying health violations. Boston will use advanced analytical techniques, combined with new sources of data, to better identify - and hopefully predict - where the risk of potential food-borne illness is high, all in an effort to reduce and eliminate serious illnesses in food establishments.
Fighting Addiction. Mayor Walsh is committed to fighting the opioid crisis in the City. The City is using analytics to identify individuals likely to overdose, to allow for intervention and assistance with recovery services.
