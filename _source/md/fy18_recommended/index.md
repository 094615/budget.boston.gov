      Mayor Walsh presented a balanced budget that maintains 
      high levels of support in critical areas such as education 
      and public safety, makes limited strategic investments,
      continues the City's commitment to addressing its long-term
      liabilities, and builds on the Administration's record of 
      strong fiscal management. This is made possible by the 
      Administration's achievement of efficiencies and savings. 
      The City's data-driven managerial approach was recently 
      validated by the affirmation of Boston's triple A bond rating.

    body: >
      At the time Mayor Walsh took office, the City of Boston had successfully 
      weathered the storms of previous recessions. However, several major revenue
      sources never fully recovered, cost pressures continued to grow, and deferred
      investments persisted across City government. In its first two years, the 
      administration has systematically engaged in independent operational reviews
      and other planning efforts aimed at making government more efficient in order 
      to address areas needing renewed attention.
