PERSONNEL CHANGES
The Personnel Summary table shows a four-year
comparison of city-funded and filled full-time
equivalent (FTE) positions. This includes both
permanent and emergency employees. The projected
FTE numbers used for FY17 are estimates based on
the personnel funding levels contained in the FY17
budgets.

FY15- FY16 FTE Changes
The total net decrease in FTEs from January 1, 2015 to
January 1, 2016 was 159.1. The majority of the
decrease was in Education and Public Safety Cabinets.
The City’s Position Review Committee continued to
review all proposed job postings for vacant positions.
All hiring was scrutinized and only critical positions
were approved.
The School Department decreased by 42.9 FTEs. The
overall number of teachers was fairly stable (-17.9 or -
0.4%) with a reduction in regular education teachers
mostly offset by more bilingual and specialist teachers.
The department also saw an increase of 50.3 special
education aides in classrooms. The decline in central
office FTEs on the general fund was primarily due to a
reduction in long-term leaves (-53).
City funded FTEs in the Public Safety Cabinet
decreased by 73.0. The Fire department received a
new SAFER grant which allowed the fall recruit class
of firefighters to be covered on the grant. The Police
department’s decline of 20.0 FTEs is due to civilian
attrition.
The Mayor’s Office Cabinet declined by 14.6 positions
between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2016. Public
Information ceased to be an independent department
in FY16 and its programs were transferred into other
departments. The communication program was added
to the Mayor’s Office. The 24 hour constituent
engagement program transferred to the Office of
Neighborhood Services in the Civic Engagement
Cabinet.
Similarly the Operations Cabinet decreased by 22
FTEs primarily due to the transfer of the Animal
Control program from Property and Construction
Management to Inspectional Services in the
Environment Cabinet. The Arts & Culture Cabinet
declined by 10.1 FTEs due to the timing of filling
vacancies in the Library Department. 

The Environment, Energy and Open Space Cabinet
increased by 23 FTEs from January 2015 to January
2016. The transfer of the Animal Control program to
Inspectional Services was partially offset by vacancies
in the department. The Parks Department grew with
the transfer of the Recreation program from BCYF.
The Health & Human Services Cabinet shows a net
decrease of 7.3 FTEs due to the transfer of Recreation
from BCYF to Parks and limited vacancies in other
departments. The Public Health Commission
increased by 7.3 FTEs, including staff for the Mobile
Sharps program and the new Office of Recovery
Services.
The Streets Cabinet decreased by 21 FTEs. Public
Works’ reduction of 20 FTEs was anticipated with
transfer of the traffic signals program to
Transportation (BTD) as well as the movement of HR
positions to the Office of Streets to consolidate human
resources functions for the entire cabinet. BTD does
not show a corresponding increase in FTEs from the
transfer of traffic signals program because of offsetting
vacancies throughout the department.
FY17 Projected FTE Changes
The City projects a net increase in FTE levels of 207.3
from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2017. The majority
of the growth is targeted in the priority areas of
education, public safety and public health.
The City will continue to review the need for hiring
into all vacant positions in FY17. Departments
eliminated over 100 long-term vacant positions in the
current budget process, saving about $4.7 million.
There will be some department reorganizations and
program transfers in FY17. While the January 1, 2017
projected FTEs reflect the new structure, the January
1, 2016 numbers are actual FTEs in the departments
prior to the changes. As a result, some of the projected
increases or decreases in individual departments are
due to organizational shifts.
A significant portion of the growth in filled FTEs from
January 2016 to January 2017 is in the Education
Cabinet. The School Department is projecting a net
increase of 86.4 FTEs with higher projections for
inclusion and bilingual teachers, inclusion aides, and
professional support. The department plans to
increase the number of kindergarten and inclusion
classrooms. Historically, the number of Public Safety employees on
the payroll as of January 1 of any year has fluctuated
with the timing of retirements and new classes. In
FY17 the Fire Department is projected to remain level
in City funded FTEs assuming normal attrition, the
hiring of a new class in the summer of 2016 and the
addition of 3 new fleet positions to address issues in
the operational audit. The department will continue to
benefit from the SAFER grant which will fund 75
firefighters in FY17. The goal of the department is to
have enough firefighters in the suppression force to
cover the minimum manning level of 262 and to
reduce overtime. The projected increase of 52.9 FTEs
in the Police Department is due to 15 police officers
coming off an expiring COPS grant, the hiring of 40
cadets under the renewed program, as well as normal
attrition. A new police class is planned for the fall of
2016.
The Health and Human Services Cabinet will increase
by 37 FTEs primarily due to significant investments in
the Public Health Commission’s Homeless Services
program and Emergency Medical Services (EMS).
The Commission’s homeless shelters will increase
staffing levels to improve safety and services for
clients. EMS will hire an extra class of 20 EMTs in
order to increase the number of ambulances on daily
shifts and reduce response times. The Public Health
Commission will also add 2 positions to assist with 311
triage for addiction services. Other departments in the
cabinet are projected to fill existing vacancies.
The Mayor’s Office Cabinet has an increase of 6 FTEs
with staff for the new Office of Returning Citizens in
the Mayor’s Office, the transfer of a position
supporting the Education Cabinet from
Intergovernmental Relations (IGR) to the Mayor’s
Office, and the anticipated filling of a vacancy in the
Elections Department to assist with new voting
requirements. The Operations Cabinet has a net
increase of 1 FTE including the transfer of the
education position from IGR to the Mayor’s Office. The
Cabinet also has the newly restructured Property
Management and Public Facilities Departments, which
were previously combined as the Property and
Construction Management. The reform is intended to
make both functions more effective.
The Civic Engagement and Economic Development
Cabinets will see small increases related to transfers.
Neighborhood Services in the Civic Engagement
Cabinet will add a position transferring from
Inspectional Services and will create a new part-time
position to support the expansion of City Hall-To-Go carts into community centers. The department also
expands capacity by adding a coordinator for language
access and an African Nations community liaison. The
Office of Economic Development will increase by 2.1
City funded FTEs as small business development
functions transfer from Neighborhood Development.
That program transfer is also supported by grant
funds. The Economic Development Cabinet will also
have a FTE neutral merger of the Licensing Board into
Consumer Affairs and Licensing.
The Arts & Culture Cabinet will increase by 4.5 FTEs
as the Library Department adds 1.5 City funded FTEs
for critical new collections, arts and preservation
positions in collaboration with a robust fundraising
support effort by Library Associates. The department
is also anticipated to fill vacancies.
Environment, Energy and Open Space is projected to
have a modest increase of 5 FTEs. The Inspectional
Services Department (ISD) will transfer a position to
Neighborhood Services and add new constituent
services position. The Environment Department will
add a Conservation Assistant. Parks and Recreation
will hire a new contract manager as it takes on
expanded contract management responsibilities
including for Millennium Park and Spectacle Island.
The Parks department is also anticipated to fill
vacancies to support its Parks First initiatives.
The Administration & Finance Cabinet will grow by
approximately 3 FTEs. Human Resources will increase
by 3 FTEs as it takes on the residency compliance
program and supports the recent upgrade of its
Human Capital Management system to provide better
services. Other projected FTE movement in the
Cabinet is due to filling vacancies, regular attrition,
and the elimination of a small number of vacant
positions.
Small FTE count increases are anticipated in the
following cabinets: Housing & Neighborhood
Development, Information & Technology, Streets, and
the Non-Mayoral group of departments. Neighborhood
Development will have a net increase of 1 FTE with
the staff for the new Office of Housing Stability,
transferred in from the Public Health Commission
emergency shelter program, offset by the transfer out
of small business development staff to Economic
Development. The Department of Innovation &
Technology will grow in order to provide 24/7 network
service to 27 BPS schools and libraries, an investment
that is supported by additional Federal
Communications Commission revenue. The rejuvenated Office of Streets will add a permitting
project manager and a chief of staff position to help
support the cabinet’s reform and planning efforts.
