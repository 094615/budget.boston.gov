HOUSING IN FY17

Implementing Boston’s Homeless Action Plan

With the publication of the Action Plan to End Chronic and Veteran Homelessness last year, Mayor Walsh reinforced the City’s commitment to continue to care for the most vulnerable populations in our community. The Action Plan calls for a single, integrated homeless system, which will move homeless individuals from Boston's streets and shelters into permanent housing quickly.

As part of the Action Plan, through the Boston Homes for the Brave initiative, Boston has housed 605 homeless veterans since July 2014, and effectively put an end to chronic veterans’ homelessness in Boston. Because of its commitment to ongoing investment in housing and services, Boston has one of the lowest rates of urban, unsheltered street homelessness in the United States; however, as a regional hub for services, the need to continue assisting Boston's homeless has persisted. With the launch of the Action Plan, Mayor Walsh has made a commitment to end chronic individual homelessness by 2018.

To support the Mayor’s Action Plan, the FY17 budget includes an increase of $1.3 million in general funds and $2 million in federal funds to provide front door triage staff at Pine Street Inn, rapid rehousing rental assistance, additional emergency shelter to families, and low barrier permanent supportive housing for the homeless.

Improving Homeless Shelter Service and Safety

The Boston Public Health Commission (PHC) provides food, shelter and other comprehensive services to over 650 homeless individuals each night at its Woods Mullen and Southampton Street shelters, and plays a critical role in the Mayor’s strategy to end homelessness in Boston. In FY17, the City is investing additional resources to enhance service levels at these locations. Additional funding allows for the full implementation of a front door triage department that enables shelter staff to meet with every new guest entering the shelters to conduct an in-depth assessment, and to develop a client-centered plan to exit the emergency shelter system as quickly as possible. The investments, which include hiring a mix of coordinators, assistant coordinators, counselors, and security staff, will also enable PHC to efficiently operate the shelters on 24/7 basis and better assist Boston’s most vulnerable population with case management, medical and behavioral health services, career counseling, job training, substance abuse prevention, and housing support.
