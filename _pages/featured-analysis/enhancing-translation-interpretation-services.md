ENHANCING TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETATION SERVICES

In FY17, Boston will launch new methods of engagement with the non-English speaking residents of Boston and centralize the translation and interpretation services within Boston 311.

With an estimated 97,000 Boston residents having limited-English proficiency, the need for a comprehensive way for government to interact with them is felt daily. Starting in FY17, Boston 311 call takers will have the ability to interact with citizens through interpreters. The City will also have new resources to translate newsletters, press releases, and other notices in a variety of languages. Through a new coordinator, the City will ensure that a high quality service is provided.
