  "mission":"The mission of the Leading the Way (LTW) campaign was to expand and protect Boston’s housing supply and stabilize neighborhoods adversely affected by the economic downturn and foreclosure boom. The campaign focused all of the City’s housing agencies around a strategy to address Boston’s housing needs in four key areas: 1) Housing Boston’s workforce through new production and enhanced access to the market; 2) Preventing foreclosures and mitigating the negative effects of foreclosures on Boston’s neighborhoods; 3) Reversing the rise in homelessness, and 4) Preserving and stabilizing the rental housing stock. In 2014, Mayor Walsh announced his Boston 2030 plan which outlines a new comprehensive approach to accommodating Boston's complex housing needs over the next 15 years. Funding committed for the new plan has been renamed the “Housing 2030 Fund” which is now included under the Neighborhood Development Operating Budget in \"Program 3: Housing Development and Services.\".",
