ENHANCING COMMUNITY CENTER HOURS AND PROGRAMMING

As the Walsh Administration evaluated Boston Centers for Youth and Families programing, they found that there were opportunities to expand operating hours in key stand-alone community centers to better meet community needs.

Many centers throughout the City close in the early evening, leaving few accessible options for youth to engage in productive and safe activity. Similarly, there are limited weekend hours at the centers for youth. In addition, BCYF faced strong interest from seniors for programing tailored to their needs.

To fill these gaps with existing resources, BCYF will redeploy their staff to dedicate the Grove Hall Community Center as a senior center, expand operating hours at all stand-alone sites, expand Saturday evening hours, enable five centers to operate 7-days per week, and allow 17 centers to operate 6-days per week. The changes in program hours and staffing redeployment planned for BCYF will result in centers that are better equipped to provide quality programming for all residents, especially seniors and youth.
