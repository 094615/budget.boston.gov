    short_desc: >
      As part of the Imagine Boston 2030 initiative to reduce cancer risks for 
      firefighters, the FY18 budget will include $500,000 for a pilot program to 
      provide industrial level cleaning for firehouses. 
    description: >
      These funds will pay to thoroughly clean ductwork, replace ceilings and/or 
      repaint where necessary and replace fabric furniture that has become contaminated 
      with potentially carcinogenic compounds. <blockquote>Combined with improvements to the 
      Standard Operating Procedures for fire fighters regarding bunker gear and personal 
      cleaning after responding to fires, the goal is to make the fire house a 
      cleaner, safer place to be.</blockquote> The department is also offering comprehensive 
      training in nutrition, physical education, and mental resiliency in order 
      to further improve the health of its employees.

      <p>In addition, the Capital Plan will include other health and safety improvements 
      to firehouse projects as a result of a recent programming study. In FY16 and FY17 
      the Fire Department, in conjunction with the Public Facilities Department, studied 
      best practices for firehouse design and now have an enhanced set of building programs 
      for new and renovated firehouses.</p>
      <p>Key changes include separating out different areas of the firehouse to 
      keep fire contaminants away from living areas and improved personal and gear 
      cleaning facilities. The replacements of Engines 42 and 17 will be among of the 
      first firehouses in the nation to reflect these enhancements.</p>
