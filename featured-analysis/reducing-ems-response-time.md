REDUCING EMS RESPONSE TIME

Boston emergency medical services (EMS) is widely regarded as being among the most efficient and progressive EMS agencies in the nation.


Beyond a focus on providing the best possible care for each patient, Boston EMS prioritizes data collection, reporting and analysis. Over the past several years, the data indicates the need for additional uniformed personnel; since 2008, the amounts of clinical incidents and ambulance transports have risen by 16% and 14%, respectively.

To meet the heightened demand for emergency medical services and to ensure Mayor Walshâ€™s vision for Boston as the healthiest city in the nation, the Administration is investing in additional EMTs and new ambulance vehicles for FY17. This investment is largely funded through additional health insurance claims revenue and reduced EMS overtime. The expansion will allow for two additional day and evening ambulance shifts and one night shift, a total of five additional ambulance tours per day. These investments will result in a number of tangible benefits, including reduced response times, fewer 911 emergency medical calls referred to private ambulance companies, lower overtime costs and expanded surge capacity during major city events.
