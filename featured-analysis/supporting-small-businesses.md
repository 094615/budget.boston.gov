SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES

Small businesses make up the foundation of Boston’s economy. Given that approximately 95% of the City’s businesses either employ fewer than 50 individuals or generate less than $5 million in annual revenue, Boston’s emergence as one of the nation’s leading economies is inextricably tied to the success of its small business community.


Recognizing this link, the Walsh Administration is realigning resources and making targeted investments in FY17 to promote a thriving, healthy, and innovative small business ecosystem.

One of the key findings from the City’s 2016 Small Business Plan was that the high number of separate municipal agencies involved in business services makes interacting with the city confusing and difficult for the small business community. Consequently, the Administration is prioritizing coordinated small business service delivery by consolidating and realigning personnel, management, and financial resources while also promoting cross-agency collaboration. In FY17, Boston will consolidate all direct-to-small-business assistance under the Economic Development Cabinet. As a result, small businesses seeking technical assistance will be able to access all available resources through a single point of contact to streamline the delivery of small business services to constituents, while allowing the City to better align and coordinate related initiatives.

In addition to realigning existing resources, the administration is making investments in small business technical assistance, which includes helping businesses improve their marketing, accessing capital markets, enhancing strategy and operations, and through providing human resources training. As part of this initiative, Boston will invest in closing the gaps in the small business ecosystem, which prevent businesses seeking to scale up from connecting with available resources. By matching the demands of growing enterprises with the City’s existing supply of resources and networks, the City will help ensure that the heart of Boston’s economy- small businesses- continue to thrive.
