      body: >
        <p>The City of Boston’s budget process is governed by the City’s Charter* and practices designed to provide transparency and gather public feedback. The chief executive officer of the City is the Mayor. Martin J. Walsh, the Mayor of the City, was elected to serve his first term from January 2014 through January 2018. The Mayor has general supervision of and control over the City’s boards, commissions, officers, and departments. The portion of the budget covering appropriations for all departments and operations of the City, except the Boston Public Schools, is prepared under the direction of the Mayor. The Boston Public Schools follow a separate process which requires the Superintendent of Schools to propose a budget to the School Committee. The Superintendent submits the School Committee approved budget to the Mayor. The Mayor submits a recommended budget, including the Boston Public Schools budget, to the City Council.</p>
        <p>The legislative body of the City is the Boston City Council, which consists of thirteen members serving two-year terms. Four councilors are elected at-large and nine are elected from geographic districts. The City Council may enact ordinances and adopt orders that the Mayor may either approve or veto. Ordinances and orders, except orders for the borrowing or appropriation of money, may be enacted by the City Council over the Mayor’s veto by a two-thirds vote. The City Council may reject or reduce a budget submitted to it by the Mayor, but may not increase it.</p>
        <p>* Chapter 486 of the Acts of 1909, and Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948 of the Commonwealth which, as amended, constitute the City’s Charter.</p>
