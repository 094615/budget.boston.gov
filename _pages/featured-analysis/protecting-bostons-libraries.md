PROTECTING BOSTON'S LIBRARIES

The Boston Public Library was the first large free municipal library in the United States.

PROTECTING SPECIAL COLLECTIONS
The Boston Public Library is committed to its special collections, and has responded appropriately to its 2015 operational review, which cited deficiencies in the inventory of special collections and the necessity for additional actions to secure collections, with the objective of keeping them organized and visible to the public. In FY15, the Library engaged an expert in library and museum special collections to begin an assessment of the Library’s print collection. The work to complete a full inventory of collections then began in FY16. While significant progress is being made, the Library and the City are already focusing on the next steps necessary to address the organization and access challenges of these valuable collections, in advance of the completion of the inventory and assessment work currently underway.

Following the operational review, the Library identified a need to fund additional positions in Special Collections to improve inventory management and rebalance stewardship responsibilities with acquisition efforts. The Library will work with the Associates of the Boston Public Library, a key affiliate organization focused on fundraising support for the conservation, preservation and organization of the Special Collections, to support this work with a goal of furthering the Library’s work to improve stewardship of the Special Collections.

BUILDING THRIVING COMMUNITY LIBRARIES
The FY17 Capital Plan continues to demonstrate Mayor Walsh’s strong commitment to revitalizing the Boston Public Library’s historic Central Library in Copley Square and its branches throughout Boston’s neighborhoods. Investing in Boston’s neighborhood branches helps ensure a vital and vibrant community. In today’s society, libraries serve as conduits for information, spaces in which citizens and neighbors meet and collaborate, and of course, as access points for reading and literacy. Among a range of services for life-long learning, the Library offers Boston’s youths a safe place to learn and access additional educational opportunities, and provide today’s citizens with resources for furthering skills and exploring new job opportunities.

In this Capital Plan, Boston will launch the reinvigoration of the Adams Branch Library, begin replacement of the Upham's Corner Branch Library, begin construction at the Dudley Branch Library, and continue construction on the renovation of the Jamaica Plain Branch. Branch library projects not only improve library services in neighborhoods, but can also assist with local economic development efforts as well.
