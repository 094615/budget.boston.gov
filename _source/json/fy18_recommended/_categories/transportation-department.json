    "The Transportation Department regulates traffic and parking for 802 miles of roadway and 3,708 public streets. In order to ensure an efficient yet safe flow of traffic and to balance competing demands for parking resources, the Department enforces 42 parking regulations, maintains and collects from the City's 7,100 parking meters, and annually replaces or repairs several thousand of the City's 300,000 street and traffic signs. The Department also continually responds to the changing transportation needs of the City and its neighborhoods by re-evaluating traffic patterns, increasing parking enforcement in response to neighborhood requests, incorporating the City's interests into state and federal roadway developments, and working to promote alternative modes of transportation for commuters."
