MOBILITY

Mayor Walsh’s FY 2017 Capital Plan projects spending over $275 million in improving Boston’s streets over the next five years. These investments will not only help strengthen Boston neighborhoods, but also unlock a new generation of inclusive growth in the City.

Delivering Exceptional Basic City Services

Through 311 requests, when out in the community, throughout Go Boston 2030 – Boston’s comprehensive transportation planning effort, and elsewhere, the Walsh Administration has heard from residents how much the basics matter. At the heart of this capital plan is a strong investment in essential city services that touch most of our residents. This budget increases Boston’s street resurfacing and sidewalk repair program by nearly $4 million and bridge repair program by over $6 million. Building on the nearly 100 miles of road work performed in the last two years, this investment will be targeted to creating more accessible sidewalks for pedestrians and smoother roads for drivers and cyclists along our major arterials. Increased bridge funding will help prepare spans, such as the North Washington Street Bridge, for more comprehensive capital improvements.


MOVING THROUGH THE CITY
Through Go Boston 2030, residents have identified safety, reliability and accessibility as top priorities for transportation improvements. This capital plan invests in those priorities. In FY17, City is investing $3.1 million in Vision Zero - a campaign Mayor Walsh launched in 2015 to eliminate serious injuries and fatalities in our roadways. To ensure our streets are well-lit,

the City will continue its comprehensive conversion of all electric street lights to LED lights, saving money and lowering energy use with each retrofit. To help people travel more efficiently and predictably through the busiest areas of the city, we will also invest over $2 million to maintain, re-time and upgrade traffic lights and pedestrian signals.

USING STREETS AS NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS
This capital plan also invests significantly in the comprehensive redesign of squares, corridors and public spaces across the city. These planning, design and construction projects stretch from Charlestown’s Sullivan Square to East Boston’s Central Square, from the Commonwealth Avenue corridor in Brighton and Allston to the Freedom Trail downtown, from Dudley Street in Roxbury to North Square in the North End, from Quincy Street in Dorchester to Audubon Circle in the Fenway. Each project will help transform these areas reflecting the vision of the local community.
