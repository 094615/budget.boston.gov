      Launched in 2016, CityScore is a tool designed to inform the Mayor, 
      City managers, and the public about quality of life and the performance 
      of City government by aggregating key performance metrics into one number.

      Over the course of FY17, CityScore has contributed to a number of City
      achievements.
