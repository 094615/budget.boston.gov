description: >
  Mayor Walsh presented a balanced budget that maintains 
  high levels of support in critical areas such as education 
  and public safety, makes limited strategic investments,
  continues the City's commitment to addressing its long-term
  liabilities, and builds on the Administration's record of 
  strong fiscal management. This is made possible by the 
  Administration's achievement of efficiencies and savings. 
  The City's data-driven managerial approach was recently 
  validated by the affirmation of Boston's triple A bond rating.
