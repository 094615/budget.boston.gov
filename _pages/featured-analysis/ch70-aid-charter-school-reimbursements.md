CHAPTER 70 AID AND CHARTER SCHOOL REIMBURSEMENTS

In FY17, Boston’s Chapter 70 Education Aid is budgeted to grow 1.7%. The Chapter 70 Education Aid formula does not work for Boston.

Despite the Commonwealth adding over $900 million to Chapter 70 Aid since FY08, Boston’s Chapter 70 Aid is only $300 thousand higher than it was in FY08.

Over the past two years, the State’s underfunding of the Charter School Tuition Reimbursement led to a $29 million revenue loss for Boston. Having focused its FY17 state budget advocacy on this item, Boston was optimistic that the State would increase its statewide funding level. Therefore, the Adopted Budget included $23.2 million in Charter School Tuition Reimbursement, based on funding levels in the Senate Budget. Following release of the City’s budget resubmission, the legislature reduced the Charter School Tuition Reimbursement funding level; this change is a revenue exposure that Boston will track as it manages the FY17 Budget. This revenue source could also be a larger liability if the state budget fails to remain in balance and emergency 9c cuts are made.

Boston’s Charter School Tuition Assessment is projected to increase by $9.9 million (6.8%), as over 10,000 students are projected to attend a Commonwealth Charter School in FY17. Boston has seen its charter school costs rise dramatically since the enactment of the 2010 Achievement Gap Legislation (130% or $88.5 million between 2011 and 2017). Unfortunately the Commonwealth has not fulfilled its obligation under the 2010 law to fund Charter School Reimbursement, totaling $29 million in lost revenue for Boston in FY15 and FY16. As Boston looks to the future, voter approval of the proposed charter school cap ballot initiative could have a shocking effect on the City’s finances, as the new state cap allowing an additional 12 schools a year would nullify community caps in practice. In 2015, Mayor Walsh proposed a moderate cap lift growing at 0.5% a year, paired with charter financing reforms that would create a reliable transition funding mechanism for Boston. This fiscally responsible approach would protect Boston taxpayers and would not pit district public schools against public charter schools.





In 1993, the Commonwealth began an effort to increase
and equalize funding for local education. The Chapter 70
formula derived from that effort establishes a foundation budget, or a minimum level of education spending in each
school district, which the state and district then share the
cost of funding. The Chapter 70 Education Aid formula
does not work for Boston. Despite the Commonwealth
adding over $900 million to Chapter 70 Aid since FY08,
Boston’s Chapter 70 Aid is only $300 thousand higher than
it was in FY08. The City received Chapter 70 education aid
totaling $209.4 million in FY14 and $211.0 million in FY15.
The City expects to receive $212.6 million from the state
in FY16 and $216.1 million in FY17, a 1.7% increase from
FY16.
Boston’s Charter School Tuition Assessment is projected
to increase by $9.9 million (6.8%) over the FY16 budget, as
over 10,000 students are projected to attend a
Commonwealth Charter School in FY17. Boston has seen
its charter school costs rise dramatically since the
enactment of the 2010 Achievement Gap Legislation
(130% or $88.5 million between 2011 and 2017).
Unfortunately the Commonwealth has not fulfilled its
obligation under the 2010 law to fund Charter School
Tuition Reimbursement, totaling about $29 million in lost
revenue for Boston in FY15 and FY16.
In the 2010 law, when tuition payments increase for a
given school district over the prior year, the state
reimburses that district for 100% of the increased cost in
the first year (when the formula is fully-funded). The
state then reimburses 25% of this first year increase
amount for each of the subsequent five years. Cities and
town are also reimbursed for the portion of the charter
school assessment related to facilities. Because the
Commonwealth has underfunded the appropriation, the
Commonwealth has only funded a portion of the first year
costs, and cities and towns have not been reimbursed for
the subsequent five years.
The net cost of charter schools to the City has been
increasing rapidly: in FY14 the cost was $75.2 million and
in FY15, $104.6 million. In FY16 the City has budgeted a
$121.9 million net impact, and in FY17, $133.6 million
(Figure 9).
