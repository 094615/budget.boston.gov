INVESTING IN THE ARTS


Building on the elevation of the arts in Boston under the Walsh Administration, the City is applying BRA public benefit funds to invest $1 million in better serving and supporting the artists of Boston. Supporting Boston artists is a key goal of Boston Creates, the forthcoming cultural plan.

The City will invest $500,000 for Boston AIR (Artists in Residence) to scale up from three to ten full residencies in Boston Centers for Youth and Families with the goal of injecting creative problem solving into municipal processes. This investment will allow for a thorough training program for participating city liaisons and artists, a materials budget for prototyping and innovation, and the evaluation of each project.

The City will support individual artists through $400,000 in direct grants to Boston artists, awarded through a competitive process.

Finally, Boston will create an Artist Resource Desk dedicated to helping artists and arts sector employees interact successfully with City Hall, and find the resources and assistance they need for their creative projects.
