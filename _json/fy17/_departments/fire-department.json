The primary goal is to target high-risk populations, firefighter safety and mitigate high incidences of death and injury. Since FY2007, the department has been awarded six grants from these programs for the purchase of firefighting and personal protective equipment such as computer terminals, computer tablets, protective rescue boots, mobile portable radios and other communications equipment. In addition, for the first time in FY2009, the program funded a rear mounted aerial ladder truck for deployment in the department’s fleet."
