STATE REVENUE


State revenue, the City’s second largest revenue source, never recovered following the last recession.

In FY17, Boston’s state revenue is budgeted to grow at $8.5 million, 2.0% over FY16. This is still $60.8 million, or 12.3%, lower than Boston’s state aid in FY08. Over that same time, state assessments, driven largely by Boston’s Charter School Tuition Assessment, have grown by $117.1 million. Together this has caused Boston’s net state aid to decline by nearly $178 million over the last decade. This trend is unsustainable and will continue to have major programmatic impacts unless reversed.
