      Departmental appropriations can be viewed by cabinet, to better reflect the overall policy priorities and trends by service area. In FY18 some programs have transferred between departments. Details of these changes are described below in each of the cabinet sections.
    description: >
      The FY18 Recommended Budget continues and expands upon a number of savings initiatives launched under Mayor Walsh’s Administration such as health care cost containment reforms, reducing overtime, inactivating vacant positions, and reducing energy consumption. It is only through continued tightening within City departments that the City will be able to afford new and expanded investments after reserving for costs associated with collective bargaining, being assessed for its increasing charter school costs, funding its pension obligations, and paying its debt service.
