Boston has limited ability to raise revenue compared to other major American cities. Boston relies heavily on property tax revenue, while other cities such as Chicago, New York and Denver collect other types of broad-based revenues, such as sales and income taxes.

It is in this context that the Walsh Administration and the City Council adopted a balanced budget relying on $2.98 billion in revenue, a $118 million (4.1%) increase over the FY16 budget, supported by strong property tax growth, moderate growth in local receipts and slow state aid growth.
