    body: >
      Mayor Walsh’s $2.08 billion FY18-22 Capital Plan will make critical 
      investments in the City’s infrastructure in every Boston neighborhood, 
      guided by Imagine Boston 2030 and the schools, streets, arts, climate 
      and resilience plans under its umbrella. <blockquote>More than 14,000 residents 
      have shaped Imagine Boston 2030 by articulating the challenges Boston faces, 
      setting goals for the city in 2030, and generating ideas about policies and 
      investments to help achieve these goals.</blockquote>

      <h5>Ambitious initiatives</h5>
      <p>An ambitious set of initiatives form the foundation of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan. Taken together, these initiatives will support Boston's dynamic economy and improve quality of life for residents by:
        <ul>
          <li>encouraging affordability;</li>
          <li>increasing access to opportunity;</li>
          <li>promoting a healthy environment; and</li>
          <li>guiding investment in the public realm.</li>
        </ul>
      <h5>Imagine Boston Capital Plan</h5>
      <p>In FY18, Mayor Walsh is launching the Imagine Boston Capital Plan to move 
      Boston residents’ priorities from idea to action, and invest in creating the 
      city Bostonians imagine for the future. Under the Imagine Boston 2030 umbrella, 
      the City is investing deeply in the core goals of BuildBPS, Go Boston 2030, 
      Boston Creates, and Climate Ready Boston. An estimated 77% of the investment 
      in the FY18-22 Capital Plan is aligned with the City’s planning efforts:</p>

      <h5>Moving into the 21st century</h5>
      <p>Mayor Walsh committed $1 billion over ten years to bring Boston's school 
      buildings into the 21st century, and this Capital Plan launches that investment 
      with funding for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>21st century classrooms;</li>
          <li>MSBA Accelerated Repair Program partnerships;</li>
          <li>completion of projects in the pipeline; and</li>
          <li>reserves for future projects identified by BuildBPS community 
          engagement.</li>
        </ul>
      <h5>Core initiatives</h5>
      <p>Boston, in collaboration with State and Federal sources, will invest $709 
      million over the next five years in implementing the core initiatives outlined 
      in Go Boston 2030:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>streets that are safer for all users of our roads and sidewalks, 
          particularly pedestrians and cyclists;</li>
          <li>travel that is more reliable and predictable; and</li>
          <li>quality transportation choices that improve access to interconnect our 
          neighborhoods for all modes of travel.</li>
        </ul>
  - col: >
      <h5>Open Space goals</h5>
      <p>Through the use of Winthrop Square proceeds, City capital dollars, and leveraging 
      external funds, Mayor Walsh plans to carry out early actions to implement Imagine 
      Boston 2030’s Open Space goals, including investing in Franklin Park as a keystone 
      park for the city, completing the Emerald Necklace, and restoring Boston Common to 
      its full vibrancy.</p>
      <h5>Preparing for climate change</h5>
      <p>Boston will prepare for climate change by investing City dollars and outside funding 
      to develop more detailed climate plans for Boston neighborhoods, especially those most 
      at risk for coastal flooding, as recommended in Climate Ready Boston.</p>
      <h5>Percent for Art Program</h5>
      <p>The Percent for Art Program, funded for the first time in this Capital Plan, 
      demonstrates the City’s leadership and commitment to sustainable funding for the arts 
      by setting aside one percent of the City’s annual capital borrowing for the 
      commissioning of public art.</p>
