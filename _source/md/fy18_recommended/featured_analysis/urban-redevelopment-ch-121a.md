    short_desc: >
      Massachusetts General Law (MGL), Chapter 121A allows local governments 
      to suspend the imposition of property taxes at their normal rates in 
      order to encourage redevelopment.
    description: >
      Chapter 121A revenues are based on two separate sections of the law 
      as described below.

      <h5>Chapter 121A formula</h5>
      <p>The Urban Redevelopment Corporation excise (Chapter 121A, section 10) is 
      collected in-lieu-of-corporate income tax for which the Commonwealth acts 
      as the collector and distributes the proceeds to municipalities.</p>
      <p>In most cases, the formula for the 121A, section 10 excise in-lieu-of-tax 
      is $10 per $1,000 of the current cash value of property plus 5% of gross 
      income.</p>

      <h5>Expected revenue</h5>
      <p>In FY15 and FY16, the City received Chapter 121A, section 10 distributions 
      of $26.2 million and $10.4 million, respectively. Chapter 121A section 10 
      revenues are budgeted at $10.5 million in FY17 and FY18.</p>
      <p>The decreases in this line in recent years is a result of the expiration of 
      several Chapter 121A section 10 agreements and the properties transitioning 
      back to regular property taxes. They contribute to the new growth portion 
      of the property tax levy.</p>

      <h5>Section 6A agreements</h5>
      <p>In addition to the Section 10 payments collected by the Commonwealth 
      described above, most 121A corporations have individual agreements with the 
      City that result in additional payments made directly to the City. These 
      “Section 6A” agreements are complex, with actual amounts owed dependent on 
      a formula that varies widely. <blockquote>The City collected Section 6A 
      payments of $26.3 million in FY15 and $29.7 million in FY16. The City expects 
      Section 6A collections to reach $15 million in both FY17 and 
      FY18.</blockquote></p>
