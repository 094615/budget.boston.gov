CONNECT BPS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET

90 schools will come onto the City's fiber-optic internet network.

The City of Bostonâ€™s Department of Innovation and Technology operates a fiber optic network (BoNet) that connects city buildings, schools, libraries, and public safety facilities. This network supports internet connectivity, public safety radio systems, Voice-over-IP phones, traffic signal management, traffic and surveillance cameras and Wicked Free Wifi. By operating its own network, the City saves millions of dollars per year in telecommunications charges.

The expansion of this network will connect approximately 90 additional public schools to BoNet, reducing costs and making more bandwidth available. The increase of the core network capacity from 1Gb to 10Gb will allow the network to handle growing traffic from video applications, general internet usage, and an increased reliance on network-based applications in schools and City operations.
