MODERNIZING PUBLIC SAFETY

A focus on innovation is not only a hallmark of the Walsh administration, but a requirement for a successful modern public safety agency. To that end, the public safety cabinet has several ongoing initiatives to take advantage of new technologies.



In 2016 the Police Department will look to begin a pilot program for police body cameras. FY17 will also be the second year of the Police Department’s radio upgrade project. Started in FY16, this is a five year capital project that upgrades both front and back end equipment and technologies. Finally, Police will also upgrade their E-9-1-1 recording system. The current analog system is at the end of its useful life; an upgrade will allow BPD to support the State’s new Next Generation 9- 1-1 system.

Based on recommendations from their operational review, the Fire Department is upgrading several outdated paper-based systems. The implementation of new scheduling software initiated in FY16 will continue into FY17. Combined with an additional module in the department’s CAD system, in FY17 incident commanders will have at their fingertips which firefighters are on shift and which are on scene at every fire incident.
