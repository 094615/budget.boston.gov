      <h5>Investing in education</h5>
      <p>Boston’s investment in education is growing by $57.8 million (4.8%), with $40.3 million 
      more projected for Boston Public Schools and $17.5 million more going towards charter 
      schools through the state assessment. This increase is in spite of a projected increase 
      of just $1 million in Chapter 70 Education Aid and a charter reimbursement that is 
      projected to be $25 million underfunded from the state.</p>
      <p>At a $1.061 billion appropriation plus a $20 million collective bargaining reserve, 
      this marks the largest Boston Public Schools budget in history.  With this investment, 
      Mayor Walsh has increased funding for the Boston Public Schools’ annual budget by $143 
      million since taking office. Funding directed to schools will increase by almost 4%, 
      even before the largest driver of BPS costs, employee collective bargaining increases, 
      are negotiated, a $25 million increase over FY17.</p>

      <h5>Closing the achievement gap</h5>
      <p>In FY18, Boston Public Schools is proposing to make important research-backed investments 
      to close the achievement gap. <blockquote>Boston is investing $14 million to give 15,000 students, 
      from kindergarten through 8th-grade, 120 additional hours of learning time — or the 
      equivalent of 20 more school days a year.</blockquote></p>
      <p>By strengthening BPS’s commitment to Excellence For All, more students in the fourth 
      and fifth grade will receive the same rigorous instruction and enriched learning 
      opportunities as those in Advanced Work Class (AWC). Boston is also making a strategic
      $1.2 million investment to support 3,000 BPS students identified by the district 
      as experiencing homelessness.</p>

      <h5>More support for schools</h5>
      <p>Finally, BPS will be providing lower performing schools with a wide-range of differentiated 
      supports, which total over $16 million. This includes a new $1.25 million reserve focused 
      on supporting low level 3, 4 and 5 schools with declining enrollment. (Learn more about 
      investments in education below.)</p>     
      <h5>Long-Term Financial Plan results</h5>
      <p>This BPS budget is made possible due to Mayor Walsh’s commitment to education funding as 
      well as the Boston Public Schools’ efforts to tighten their budget management and 
      identify operational efficiencies in the central office.  The BPS Long-Term Financial 
      Plan has begun to pay off with efficiencies reflected in this budget including $4.3 
      million of savings in the Central Office and continued efforts to achieve 
      transportation efficiencies.</p>
