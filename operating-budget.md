      The FY17 Adopted Operating Budget totals $2.98
      billion and represents an increase of $118 million or
      4.1% over FY16. The FY17 budget continues the City’s
      strong fiscal management record, implements
      thoughtful reforms that achieve savings and
      modernize processes, and reinvests those savings in
      targeted initiatives toward achieving a thriving,
      healthy and innovative City.

      On the expenditure side, the FY17 budget reflects an
      increase of $118 million or 4.1% over the FY16 budget
      and $95.4 million (3.3%) over FY16 estimated
      expenditures. Of that growth, City Departments,
      Boston Public Schools (BPS) and the Public Health
      Commission (PHC) (net health insurance and pension
      costs) are growing by $29.3 million or 1.5% over FY16
      estimated expenditures. These departmental
      increases are low relative to other years due to the
      expiration of nearly all of collective bargaining
      agreements by early in the fiscal year.

    body: >
      On the expenditure side of the budget, total
      appropriations increase by $83.2 million or 3.7% and
      fixed costs increase by $31.5 million or 5.4%. Selected
      FY17 budgeted appropriations compare with FY16
      budgeted appropriations as follows: City
      Appropriations increase $55.2 million or 4.8%, the
      Boston Public Health Commission increases by $3.3
      million or 4.5%, and the School Department increases
      $13.5 million or 1.3%. Within City Appropriations,
      actual City Departments are increasing by $18.7
      million or 2.0% over FY16 estimated spending. These
      departmental increases are low relative to other years
      due to the expiration of nearly all of collective
      bargaining agreements, except for the firefighters
      union, by early in the fiscal year. This
      recommendation fully budgets for public safety
      overtime accounting for $20.6 million of the increase
      over FY16 budget, where public safety budget is
      underfunded. Also contained within City
      Appropriations are 11 central appropriations including
      large appropriations for Health Insurance of $206.2
      million and Medicare of $10 million that collectively
      are increasing by $15.9 million or 7.3%
      <br /><br />
      FY17 budgeted fixed costs compare with FY16
      budgeted fixed costs as follows: Pensions increase $5.3
      million or 2.9%; Debt Service increases $13.4 million or
      8.1%; Charter School Tuition state assessment
      increases $11.4 million or 7.8%; MBTA state
      assessment increases by $0.8 million or 1.0%; and
      other state assessments increases $69 thousand or
      1.5%.

  - title: Expenditures
    body: >
      Expenditures are broken down into two primary
      groups: (1) appropriations directly related to
      departmental services and (2) fixed and mandated
      costs. FY17 appropriations are subdivided into three
      subgroups as follows:
      <ul>
      <li>City Appropriations, which includes all
      operating department appropriations,
      centrally budgeted costs such as health
      insurance and Medicare, a risk retention
      reserve and a set-aside for tax title and
      annual audit expenses;</li>
      <li>Boston Public Health Commission (PHC),
      the City appropriation for the quasiindependent
      authority and successor to the
      Department of Health and Hospitals;</li>
      <li>and School Department, the City
      appropriation for the Boston Public Schools
      (BPS).</li>
      </ul>
      Appropriations are also presented by expenditure
      category across the three subgroups. (Figure 6)
      <br /><br />
      Personnel Services include salaries, overtime,
      unemployment compensation and workers’
      compensation, and a collective bargaining reserve for
      estimated wage increases for union employees whose
      agreements are not settled. Almost all of the City’s
      collective bargaining agreements will expire in FY17.
      <br /><br />
      The Health Benefits category includes the cost of
      health, dental and life insurance for City, BPS and
      PHC employees and retirees, employer Medicare payroll
      taxes, and the appropriation for Other PostEmployment
      Benefits (OPEB).
      <br /><br />
      The Contractual Services category includes
      expenditures for communications, repairs and service
      to buildings, equipment and vehicles, transportation,
      trash collection and disposal, as well as outside legal,
      advertising, and printing expenses.
      <br /><br />
      Included in the “Other” category are supplies and
      materials such as gasoline, uniform allowances, office
      supplies, workers’ compensation medical expenses,
      medical indemnification in the Fire and Police
      Departments, legal liabilities, and aid to veterans. Also
      included in the “Other” category are appropriations for
      equipment, vehicles, a risk retention reserve, the
      Housing Trust Fund, tax title, and funding for the
      City’s outside audit.
