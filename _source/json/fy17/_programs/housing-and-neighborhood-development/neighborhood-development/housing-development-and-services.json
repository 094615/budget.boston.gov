  "description":"DND's Housing Development and Services programs support a wide range of housing creation and support activities that strive to make Boston the most livable city in the nation. This is accomplished through the work of the Boston Home Center (BHC), Neighborhood Housing Development (NHD), and the Supportive Housing (SH) divisions.  BHC is designed to help Boston residents obtain, retain, and improve their homes.  NHD works with non-profit and for-profit partners to develop and preserve affordable housing.  SH provides funding for housing and supportive services for Boston&rsquo;s homeless and those at risk of homelessness.\r\nIn 2014, Mayor Walsh announced his Boston 2030 plan which outlines a new comprehensive approach to accommodating Boston's complex housing needs over the next 15 years.   Funding committed for the new plan has been renamed the &ldquo;Housing 2030 Fund&ldquo;; which is included in the Neighborhood Development Operating Budget in &ldquo;Program 3. Housing Development and Services.&ldquo;;",
