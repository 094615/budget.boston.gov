BUILDING A BETTER BOSTON CAPITAL PROGRAM


The Building a Better Boston Capital Program invests in our City to promote economic development, neighborhood vitality, quality education, health care, and public safety.


As Boston looks toward the future through Imagine Boston 2030, Bostonians have defined four goals to guide our City’s growth:

Provide quality of life in accessible neighborhoods.
Drive inclusive economic growth.
Invest in infrastructure, open space and culture.
Promote a healthy environment and adapt to climate changes.
Over the next several years, the City’s Building a Better Boston Capital Plan will play a critical role in achieving several of these goals, as a major investment program for the City’s future. This year, Boston’s Capital Plan aims to initiate early action items from the City’s Open Space Plan and Go Boston 2030 while prudently preserving capacity for future projects from ongoing City planning initiatives, especially Build BPS, the 10- year educational and facilities master plan for Boston Public Schools.

Through the Building a Better Boston Capital Plan, the City is also making new capital investments - investments in the City’s infrastructure paid for in a large part through annual borrowing. The City will be able to make new investments in the Capital Plan due to a reevaluation of all future projects relative to immediate need, increasing annual borrowing within the City’s debt affordability policy, utilizing the City’s Parking Meter Fund to support a portion of the Northern Avenue Bridge project, and applying the City’s one-time FY16 snow surplus toward one-time capital projects. The Capital Plan also preserves bond cap for future projects coming out of Build BPS.
