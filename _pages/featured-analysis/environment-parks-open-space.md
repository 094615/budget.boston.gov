ENVIRONMENT, PARKS, AND OPEN SPACE

Mayor Walsh has dedicated $47.6 million in capital funds to Boston’s parks, and the FY17 operating budget will be the largest in the department's history.

Parks First, launching this spring with capital and operating investments, is a comprehensive initiative ensuring that Boston’s open spaces are among the nation’s most accessible and equitable. Parks First is a commitment to achieving these goals through investments in excellence in design and management. Parks First posits that Boston’s open spaces are among the first tools that can be used in fostering community, adapting to climate change, promoting public health and wellness, and creating livable neighborhoods in an era of increasing housing density. To date, the Walsh administration made an unprecedented investment in Parks. 


IMPROVING ACCESS
A two-year, $5 million dollar investment in pathway and entrance improvements to Boston’s largest open space, Franklin Park, will increase usage and safety of this Emerald Necklace anchor for the neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, and Dorchester, and for visitors citywide. This project is the largest park-only project in Franklin Park in close to a century. An expansion of Boston’s seasonal park ranger workforce will ensure that Boston’s green spaces are welcoming and safe spaces for residents and visitors. These ambassadors will patrol the Emerald Necklace, including America’s first park, Boston Common.

ENHANCING EQUITY
Ninety-seven percent of Bostonians live within a ten-minute walk of a park, but those spaces are only truly equitable if they serve the diverse needs of all residents. Parks First recognizes the need for inclusive design and has created robust budgets for park renovation projects at Smith Playground in Allston, Noyes Park in East Boston, and Garvey Playground in Dorchester.

FY17 will see the beginning of a comprehensive redesign of the 45-acre Harambee Park in Dorchester and Mattapan. The renovation will include environmental improvements, pedestrian pathways, field renovations and entrance improvements transforming Harambee into a premier example of community-led comprehensive planning.

STRIVING TOWARD EXCELLENCE
Last year, Mayor Walsh created the first second maintenance shift in Boston Parks and Recreation Department history. Parks First will expand the department’s seasonal maintenance workforce to ensure that Boston’s neighborhood parks receive an increased level of care.

Parks First will expand recycling into two to three signature parks, providing Bostonians with an opportunity to act as stewards of their environment and complement the City’s Greenovate strategy.
