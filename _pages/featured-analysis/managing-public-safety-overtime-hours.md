MANAGING PUBLIC SAFETY OVERTIME HOURS


The Walsh Administration is fully budgeting for public safety overtime for the first time in over 15 years.

Previously the true cost of public safety overtime was not apparent in the budget, as it was budgeted at an inadequate level, accounted for through conservative revenue budgeting, and then covered at year end with revenue surpluses. This practice provided no functional limit on overtime spending. From FY10 to FY15, the Police Department’s overtime hours increased 34% and the Fire Department’s overtime hours increased 17%. Recognizing the need to look critically at every dollar spent on overtime, the Police Department, under Mayor Walsh’s leadership, began reducing overtime in FY16 by reviewing staffing levels at each district and more carefully examining court overtime spending. In FY17, public safety overtime is budgeted $20 million above FY16 budgeted levels, but lower than FY16 estimated spending due to the Police Department’s 15% reduction in hours from FY15 and the Fire Department’s 5% reduction in hours from FY16.
