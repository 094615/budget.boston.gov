        " In FY17, the City is investing $3.1 million in Vision Zero â€“ an initiative focused on improving safety eliminating serious injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians through improved roadway design and public education; and the Walkable Streets program which takes a holistic look at pedestrian access by reconstructing long sidewalk sections.",
        "Through ongoing annual programs the Public Works Department will reconstruct five lane-miles of roadway and resurface 40 lane-miles of roadway, install 10 miles of bike lanes and 800 ADA/MAABcompliant pedestrian ramps, and continue the replacement of existing street light fixtures with LED fixtures. In FY17 the capital plan provides increased funding for roadway resurfacing, sidewalk repairs, and improvements to the Freedom Trail. The reconstruction program includes several large-scale, significant projects, including the $29 million Connect Historic Boston program, funded in part with a federal grant; Quincy Street as part of the Choice Neighborhood in Roxbury; and a redesigned Central Square in East Boston."
