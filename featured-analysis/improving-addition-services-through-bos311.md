IMPROVING ADDICTION SERVICES THROUGH BOSTON 311

With the rise of opioid related addictions over the past several years in Massachusetts and Greater Boston, the importance of treatment services has never been greater.


As a result, the City is adding resources to the Public Health Commission’s PAATHS (Providing Access to Addictions Treatment, Hope and Support) program, a one-stop shop for those seeking information about, or access to, addiction treatment services. The current program, which offers walk-in hours and phone support, has proven successful in connecting individuals to a wide range of addiction services.

The FY17 investment will enable the program to scale up its services through the Boston 311service, the city’s innovative and nationally recognized municipal service application. PHC projects that this expansion will increase the number of weekly PAATHS calls from 100 to 300, and consequently increase the amount of people connected to vital recovery services. To meet this anticipated demand, the investment includes the hiring of full time clinicians to provide advice, referral, and counseling via phone at the PAATHS program. Clinicians will take calls from Boston 311 and triage clients to the appropriate services.
